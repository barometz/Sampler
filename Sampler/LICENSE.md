Licenses for Sampler and third-party code
=========================================

Sampler makes use of two third-party products: AudioMixer (by Nightfox) and 
ExpressionEval (by Drew Wilson). For these products the following applies:

ExpressionEval
--------------
ExpressionEval is not my work, save for some minor adjustments.  There is no 
license attached so strictly speaking I probably shouldn't share it like this, 
but oh what the hell.

AudioMixer
----------
Audiomixer is not my work, save for some minor adjustments.  The license 
doesn't say anything about credit, but credit is due so here it is.
